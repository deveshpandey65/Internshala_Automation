    "Background:\nIn today's digital age, the ability to efficiently manage documents is crucial for organizations. However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with non-machine-readable documents such as PDFs or Word documents. These formats hinder automation and make it difficult to extract meaningful insights from the data they contain. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a solution that can both restrict the ingestion of non-machine-readable documents and facilitate the creation of machine-readable documents seamlessly.\nDescription:\nThe above problem statement envisages:\n1. To develop an application that can restrict software applications from ingesting any non-machine-readable document format such as PDFs, DOCs, or any other document types.\n2. To create a mechanism within the application to generate machine-readable documents automatically whenever a new document is created, regardless of its source - scanned, generated through a software application, or otherwise.\nExpected Solution:\nThe TransformoDocs application aims to address the challenges associated with managing non-machine-readable documents by developing a comprehensive document transformation application. It will help in realizing the benefits of search-ability, artificial intelligence, accessibility to persons with disability, machine translation and access to data across applications and data exchanges. This application may offer efficient data extraction, standardized processing, workflow automation, data quality improvement, scalability, integration with external systems, advanced analytics, and compliance with regulatory requirements ultimately unlocking the value of their data.",
